This simulation is written for Python 3 and tested with Python 3.4.2 on Windows 8.1 x64 and Ubuntu 14.10 x64.  It relies on the queue, random, math, and csv modules included in standard Python installations.

5 files are necessary to run the simulation:
    - Car.py
    - Lane.py
    - Light.py
    - TrafficSimulation.py
    - main.py

Run main.py to run the simulation and create "output.csv".  All inputs to the simulation are contained in main.py and can be changed.
