This simulation is written for Python 3 and tested with Python 3.4.2 on Windows 8.1 x64 and Ubuntu 14.10 x64.  It relies on the queue, random, math, and csv modules included in standard Python installations.

The following files files are necessary to run the simulation:
    - Car.py
    - Lane.py
    - Light.py
    - PQ.py
    - RandomNumberGenerator.py
    - TrafficSimulation.py
    - main.py
    - data
        - Travel Matrix.csv
        - Signal Timings.csv
        - Arrival Rates.csv
        - Capacity.csv

Run main.py to run the simulation and create "output.txt".
